I'm a Graphics/Engine programmer from Italy with 3 years of experience, currently employed at Stormind Games SRL.

In my free time i like to work on my (yet unnamed) game engine, playing video games and cooking. 

I'm most active on Bluesky [@mayoaddictrat](https://bsky.app/profile/mayoaddictrat.bsky.social) and Discord (`mayoaddictrat`), if you want to talk to me.
